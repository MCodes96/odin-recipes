## An HMTL project on "The Odin Project"

### Before the project
This is the first project in the curriculum of "The Odin Project".
While being fairly simple, this project teaches the basics of HTML
and builds the foundation for future projects.
Even though this is just repetition, I'm still excited to take on
the "challenge".

### After the project
