## An HMTL project on "The Odin Project"

### Before the project
This is the first project in the curriculum of "The Odin Project".
While being fairly simple, this project teaches the basics of HTML
and builds the foundation for future projects.
Even though this is just repetition, I'm still excited to take on
the "challenge".

### After the project
As expected this project was simple but it still doesn't fail to present
how websites are structured and how each webpage adds up to a "website".
I used basic html tags in this project.
